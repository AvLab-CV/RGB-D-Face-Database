# RGB-D-Face-Database ([Website](https://sites.google.com/site/avlrgbdfacedatabase/))

Gee-Sern Jison Hsu , Yu-Lun Liu ; Hsiao-Chia Peng , Po-Xun Wu

The RGBDFaces contains 28 subjects, 13 poses (L90.,L75., L60., L45., ... , R60., R75.,R90) and 5 distances (1m, 1.2m, 1.5m, 1.7m and 2m) between the Kinect sensor and the subject. The set of a sample subject is shown below.

We hope that the Pulse from face (RGB-D-Face) database could revolutionized the landscape of heart rate detection research. A detailed introduction of RGB-D-Face can be found in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6914582).

Here are some examples from the dataset.
