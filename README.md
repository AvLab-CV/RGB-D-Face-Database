Most RGB-D-based research focuses on scene reconstruction, gesture analysis, and simultaneous localization and mapping, but only a few study its impacts on face recognition. A common yet challenging scenario considered in face recognition takes a single 2D face of frontal pose as the gallery and other poses as the probe set. We consider a similar scenario but with an RGB-D image pair taken at frontal pose for each subject in the gallery, only 2D images with a large scope of pose variations in the probe set, and study the advantage of the additional depth map on top of the regular RGB image.
We consider a scenario in which an RGB-D image of a frontal face is collected for each subject in the gallery set, but the probe set contains RGB images only. This scenario is to simulate a situation that an RGB-D camera is available only at user registration phase, but recognition must be carried out on RGB images that can be easily obtained by a regular camera without the depth channel. 

We hope that the RGB-D-Face database could revolutionized the landscape of heart rate detection research. A detailed introduction of RGB-D-Face can be found in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6914582).

Here are some examples from the dataset.
